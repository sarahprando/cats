# 🐾 Cat Social Network

A fun and modern **social network for cats**, built with **Next.js**.  
This project is part of the **Origamid Next.js course**, which I’m customizing and expanding with my own design and features.  
It allows users (and their feline friends 😺) to connect, share photos, and explore a playful community — designed with a clean, responsive interface and optimized performance.
